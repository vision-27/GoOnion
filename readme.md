## üó£Ô∏è Example Conversation

```
üåç Welcome to the AI Travel Planner! üåç

üìç Where are you traveling FROM? New York
üìç Where do you want to travel TO? Tokyo
üìÖ Are your travel dates flexible? yes

üéØ Perfect! Let me analyze the best times to visit Tokyo...

üå§Ô∏è Consulting weather experts...

üèÜ EXPERT RECOMMENDATIONS:
The best time to visit Tokyo is during spring (March-May) for cherry 
blossoms and mild weather, or autumn (September-November) for pleasant 
temperatures and beautiful foliage. Avoid July-August due to extreme 
heat and humidity, and the rainy season in June...

Based on this analysis, which month sounds good to you? April

What specific dates in April? 2024-04-10, 2024-04-17

üé® Now let's personalize your trip:
‚è±Ô∏è How many days will you stay? 7
üåÖ Do you prefer day activities, night activities, or mixed? mixed
üéØ What are you interested in? art, food, traditional culture, temples

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. Multi-Agent Architecture
Each specialist agent is initialized with:
- **Domain-specific system prompts**
- **Specialized tool functions**
- **Knowledge area expertise**

### 2. Dynamic Function Calling
```python
# Agents can call specialized functions
def analyze_weather_and_seasons(location: str, travel_month: str) -> Dict:
    """Analyze weather using AI knowledge, not static data"""
    
def create_optimized_route(location: str, interests: List[str], duration_days: int) -> Dict:
    """Create routes using real local knowledge"""
```

### 3. Intelligent Coordination
The coordinator routes user queries to appropriate agents:
- Weather questions ‚Üí Weather Agent
- Flight queries ‚Üí Booking Agent  
- Route planning ‚Üí Route Agent
- Activity suggestions ‚Üí Attractions Agent

### 4. Conversational Memory
Each agent maintains conversation history for context-aware responses.

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Agents

```python
class RestaurantAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="Restaurant & Dining Expert",
            system_prompt="You are a restaurant and dining specialist...",
            tools=[find_restaurants, analyze_food_scene]
        )
```

### Modifying Agent Behavior

Edit the `system_prompt` in each agent's initialization:

```python
class WeatherAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="Weather and Seasonal Expert",
            system_prompt="""Your custom prompt here...""",
            tools=[analyze_weather_and_seasons, recommend_best_travel_dates]
        )
```

### Adding New Tools

Create new analysis functions:

```python
def analyze_local_transportation(city: str, mobility_needs: str) -> Dict:
    """Analyze transportation options for specific mobility needs"""
    prompt = f"Analyze accessible transportation in {city} for {mobility_needs}"
    # Implementation here
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### API Key Problems
```
Error: GEMINI_API_KEY not found in environment
```
**Solution**: Check that your `.env` file exists and contains your API key:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
```

#### Import Errors
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google.generativeai'
```
**Solution**: Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install google-generativeai python-dotenv
```

#### Rate Limiting
If you encounter rate limits, the system will gracefully handle errors and provide fallback responses.

### Debugging Mode

Enable verbose logging by modifying the model initialization:

```python
# In BaseAgent.__init__()
self.model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro", verbose=True)
```

### Performance Tips

- **Batch Questions**: Ask related questions together
- **Be Specific**: Detailed queries get better responses
- **Use Context**: Reference previous answers in follow-ups
